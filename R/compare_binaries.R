#' Compare two binary rasters
#'
#' @description This function allows to compare binary rasters to better see patterns.
#' @usage compare_binaries(r1,r2)
#' @param r1 Binary raster from present/current distribution.
#' @param r2 Binary raster from future/projected distribution.
#' @details This function will compare two rasters, returning absence, expansion, retraction and permanence. Absence (value = 1) is a cell where the species is absent in both r1 and r2. Expansion (value = 2) is a cell where species is absent in r1 and present in r2. Retraction (value = 3) is a cell where species is present in r1, but absent in r2. Finally, permanence (value = 4) is a cell where species is present in both r1 and r2.
